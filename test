Project Management Assignment B

 	This research paper is concentrated on the “Process Groups and “Knowledge Areas” of project management.

	For any project to be completed successfully as planned it has to be followed with the 5 Process groups like Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling and Closing, along with 9 project management knowledge areas Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Human Resource, Communications, Risk and Procurement as described by PMI (Project Management Institute) 

	Going more in depth of the process groups gives us more knowledge on how it helps the project to achieve great results. 

Process Groups:
Initiating: Generally, this phase of a project defines a new project or new era of the existing project. All the required resources (Human Resources), Internal and External Stakeholders and anyone that may be involving in the future scope of the project are recruited or invited for a new project beginning. If this is a new requirement then even a project manager will be assigned for this as he/she will have to manage the rest of project scope. All this data will be listed in a project charter and sent for approval from the higher management and once an approval is given the project is officially now authorized to run in an organization and the respective project manager will start the project with a kick-off meeting by having an initial discussion with the complete team members.
Planning: A project success can actually start right form this stage, when a project is not properly planned it could cost the organization a lot of money hence this is a very crucial phase. No of resources required for a project, budget estimates, milestones, tasks required, risks involved has to be analyzed in a detailed manner to get optimum results from the next executing phase. The planning phase undergoes multiple iterations of planning to find the most suitable plan for executing the project. The final plan is drafted in detail for project team members reference.
Executing: This is the phase where all the planning will be put into action and the main part of this phase is development of the product and conduct testing for the same to get the final end product to perfection.

Monitoring : In the monitoring phase the stakeholders are updated with the current production phase of the product and the performance of the product is also measured on a periodic phase and if any issues arise it will be addressed by the development team and the product will be re-tested and deployed to handle the issues. Once the product is out in the market for long without any issues the monitoring phase will come to an end. 

Closing: It is the final stage of the project management process and the success rate of the product id then declared to the sponsored organization. It also concentrates on handling all the detailed project deliverables to stakeholders. After this phase is completed a post implementation review is completed to determine success rate of the project. 
Knowledge Areas:
Integration: Integration is the most key areas of Knowledge as it involved in evert process group like preparation of the project charter, planning of the project, executing the work by handling all the issues (where integration is the key), monitoring the project work and then in closing phase as well. The main purpose of the integration management knowledge area processes is the execution and delivery of the project work end-to-end successfully.

Scope: This project management knowledge area has six processes. Four of them belong to planning. These are planning the scope management, collecting requirements, defining the scope and creating WBS. Two processes belong to the monitoring and controlling process group. These are validating the scope and controlling the scope. Scope management processes aim to control scope in a project and protects scope creep.

Cost: This project management knowledge area has four processes. These are planning cost management, estimating costs, determining the budget and controlling costs. Cost management processes aim to complete the project under a planned budget.

Quality: This project management knowledge area has three processes. Planning the quality management process belongs to the planning step, performing the quality assurance process belongs to the executing and controlling the quality process belongs to the monitoring and controlling. Quality management processes ensure to meet the projects’ quality objectives.

Resource Management: This project management knowledge area has four processes. Planning the resource management process belongs to planning phase and three other processes belong to the executing process group. These are: acquiring the project team, developing the project team and managing the project team. Project activities are performed by project team members. Resource management processes mainly aim to people management of project resources.
Note that, this knowledge area was known as Human Resource Management Knowledge area before PMBOK 6th Ed changes.
Communications: This project management knowledge area has three processes. These are planning the communications management which belongs to planning phase, managing communications which belong to executing phase and controlling communications which belong to the monitoring and controlling. A certain amount of communication will take place in a project internally and externally. Management of information dissemination is done with the help of communication management processes.
Risk Management: Since risks are evaluated mainly in the planning phase, five out of six processes belong to the planning phase. These are planning the risk management, identifying risks, performing qualitative risk analysis, performing quantitative risk analysis and planning risk responses. And one process that belongs to monitoring phase is controlling risks. Risk management processes mainly aim to reduce the impacts of risks to the project once they occur.

Procurement: This project management knowledge area has four processes. Planning procurement management belongs to planning, conducting procurements belong to executing phase, controlling procurements belong to monitoring and controlling phase and closing procurements belong to project closure. The main purpose of procurement processes is management and coordination of purchasing activities in a project.

Stakeholder Management: This project management knowledge area has four processes. These are: identifying stakeholders, planning stakeholder management, managing stakeholder management and controlling stakeholder management. Stakeholder management processes help to manage expectations of project stakeholders during the project.
As you see all project management knowledge areas has one or more process belonging to the 5 project management process groups. When the project managers are well aware of all the project management knowledge areas, they can conduct a project more efficiently.
