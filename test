					This research paper is concentrated on the “Process Groups and “Knowledge Areas” of project management.
					


					For any project to be completed successfully as planned it has to be followed with the 5 Process groups like Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling and Closing, along with 9 project management knowledge areas Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Human Resource, Communications, Risk and Procurement as described by PMI (Project Management Institute) 
					

						Going more in depth of the process groups gives us more knowledge on how it helps the project to achieve great results. 
					

					Process Groups:
					Initiating: Generally, this phase of a project defines a new project or new era of the existing project. All the required resources (Human Resources), Internal and External Stakeholders and anyone that may be involving in the future scope of the project are recruited or invited for a new project beginning. If this is a new requirement then even a project manager will be assigned for this as he/she will have to manage the rest of project scope. All this data will be listed in a project charter and sent for approval from the higher management and once an approval is given the project is officially now authorized to run in an organization and the respective project manager will start the project with a kick-off meeting by having an initial discussion with the complete team members.
					Planning: A project success can actually start right form this stage, when a project is not properly planned it could cost the organization a lot of money hence this is a very crucial phase. No of resources required for a project, budget estimates, milestones, tasks required, risks involved has to be analyzed in a detailed manner to get optimum results from the next executing phase. The planning phase undergoes multiple iterations of planning to find the most suitable plan for executing the project. The final plan is drafted in detail for project team members reference.
					Executing: This is the phase where all the planning will be put into action and the main part of this phase is development of the product and conduct testing for the same to get the final end product to perfection.
					

					Monitoring : In the monitoring phase the stakeholders are updated with the current production phase of the product and the performance of the product is also measured on a periodic phase and if any issues arise it will be addressed by the development team and the product will be re-tested and deployed to handle the issues. Once the product is out in the market for long without any issues the monitoring phase will come to an end. 
					

					Closing: It is the final stage of the project management process and the success rate of the product id then declared to the sponsored organization. It also concentrates on handling all the detailed project deliverables to stakeholders. After this phase is completed a post implementation review is completed to determine success rate of the project. 





					Knowledge Areas:

					Integration: Integration is the most key areas of Knowledge as it involved in every process group like preparation of the project charter, planning of the project, executing the work by handling all the issues (where integration is the key), monitoring the project work and then in closing phase as well. The main purpose of the integration management knowledge area processes is the execution and delivery of the project work end-to-end successfully.
					

					Scope: Scope knowledge area is involved in multiple process groups for example in Initiating phase we need to collect the requirement for the project and for that we need to identify the scope of the project and also creating the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). Once the project has reached the controlling and maintaining phase the scope has to be validated on a periodic basis. 
					

					Cost: Cost is mainly part of Planning phase where a project manager has to identify the cost of complete project with all scenarios in mind. The same planned cost has to be followed throughout the Executing phase and the control and monitoring phase since the cost of the project will go on until the project is closed. 
					
					Quality: For any project or product to be success Quality is very essential. Quality of a product s planned in the planning phase but the execution of the quality has to be done in the Executing, Controlling and Monitoring phase. Quality management also helps us to meet the project requirements. 
					

					Resource Management: For anything to happen a human resource is very much needed starting from project manager. Only planning can be done by the project manager but the execution of the project can only be handled by the other team members. So recruiting the best possible resources for a project can yield extraordinary end results. The phase is also responsible when acquiring the project teams or even when creating a new project. This knowledge area is also known as “Human Resource Management”.
					
					Communications: When a project is being handled if there is any communication gap between the team members the final output is going to be a disaster, because the communication gap will destroy the timelines of the project. Managing the communications of the project belongs to executing phase and the controlling of communication belong to the controlling and monitoring phase. A certain amount of communication will take place in a project internally and externally

					Risk Management: During the planning phase the risks of a project has to be analyzed so that the planning of the project can be processed smoothly. Different parts of risk analysis include planning the risk management, identifying risks, performing qualitative risk analysis, performing quantitative risk analysis and planning risk responses. Once the project development is completed and is sent to production, it has to be frequently monitored for various risks to avoid any damage to the organization.
					

					Procurement: This phase is also involved during the planning phase and most of it involved during the executing phase as all data has to be procured for the completion of the project development and closing the procurements belong to the closing phase of the process groups. 
					
					Stakeholder Management: Stakeholders are involved in pretty much every phase of the project management, the stakeholders will be affected high time if not involved, so starting with initiation phase project manager has to invite all the stakeholders for the Kick off meeting, in the planning phase stakeholders are involved to manage the timeline impact for different project groups, and during the executing phase stakeholders are given the current project status and in controlling and monitoring phase the stakeholders are the key area since any problem with the product affects stakeholders directly or in-directly. 
					As you see all project management knowledge areas has one or more process belonging to the 5 project management process groups. When the project managers are well aware of all the project management knowledge areas, they can handle a project much efficiently.
